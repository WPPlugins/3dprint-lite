== Description ==

If you have a 3D printer and wish to charge for model printing this plugin is for you. 

How it works:

Site administrator configures printers, materials and pricing in the admin. Customers upload their models, choose printer and material, see the estimated price, input their email address and comments and press the "Request a Quote" button. 
The admin receives the request notification by email and sends the quotes through the Price Request Manager or discards the quote requests.

* Configurable printers, filaments and coatings.
* Build tray shape (rectangle, circle).
* Material/coating shininess (plastic, wood, metal).
* Transparent and glowing materials.
* Customizable pricing: can be configured to charge per model weight, filament volume or bounding box volume.
* Large file upload support (upload chunking).
* Model scaling.
* Drag and drop.
* Filament price calculator.
* Email notification.
* Price request manager.
* Translation ready.
* Responsive layout.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin offer WooCommerce integration? =

Only the premium version - http://www.wp3dprinting.com/

= How is the printing price calculated? =

Generally the formula is: printing price = printer cost + material cost . Printer and material cost are calculated depending on the settings on the 3D Printing page. The cost can be calculated through filament volume, weight or bounding box. 

= Does the plugin check models for printability? =

The current version only checks if the model is larger than the selected printer size.

= How do I set up different price rates for different amounts of material and volume? =

For example you want to charge 0.5$ for < 200cm3, 0.4$ for >200cm3, 0.3$ for >400cm3. Instead of regular numeric price enter this formula: 0:0.5;200:0.4;400:0.3

The price and amount are delimted by ":" symbol and price-amount pairs are delimited by ";". This works on printer, material and coating prices.

= How do I translate the plugin? =

The easiest way is to use this plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/
